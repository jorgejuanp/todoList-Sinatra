# todoList / Sinatra

We're going to create a Sinatra todo list. The "todo" is the "hello world" of the web world. We're going to put those TDD skills to the test, and later on, incorporate this application into a Sinatra web application.

**Part 1**

We're going to create our Todolist, and Task classes via TDD. These classes are going to have all of the functions that you would think about in a todo list, creating new tasks, deleting tasks, updating tasks, completing tasks, and maybe even a few more surprises.


**Part 2**

We have to incorporate our Todolist class into a sinatra web application. What does this really mean? Well we have all of our todo list methods ready to go and waiting for us, now we need to add sinatra functionality to them. Before we could display tasks in a terminal, and perform actions on them, now we need to "wire them up" and go live.

We will add tasks to the todo list through forms, display our tasks, have the ability to complete / delete tasks, and then update the task to something different.
